  "🧮 What is a Carbon Footprint?": {
    1: "Measures total carbon emissions from an activity or product, standardized as CO₂ equivalents (CO₂e).",
    2: "Philippines' average per capita emissions are 2.27 tons CO₂e (Climate Change Performance Index).",
  },
  "🛑 What Makes Up a Carbon Footprint?": {
    "CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide)": "Largest share of emissions.",
    "CH₄ (Methane)": "Smaller quantity but much more potent.",
    "N₂O (Nitrous Oxide)": "Emitted in small amounts but highly impactful on global warming.",
  },
  "🌍 Our Actions Impact the Carbon Footprint": {
    "Transportation": "Contributes 17.9% of global GHG emissions, including cars, planes, ships, trains, and daily commutes.",
    "Energy Production & Use": "Responsible for 39.3% from electricity and heat generation and 9.9% from energy used in homes/buildings. Efficiency of appliances and energy sources play key roles.",
    "Agriculture": "Accounts for 12% of global emissions, including livestock, rice farming, and fertilizer use that emit methane and nitrous oxide.",

    "Average Footprint Today":
      "Each person emits about 4 tons of CO₂e per year.",
    "Target for 2050":
      "To meet the Paris Agreement, this must drop below 2 tons per person annually.",

  "✨ Philippine Context": {
    "Current Per Capita Footprint":
      "Filipinos average 2.27 tons of CO₂e per year—close to the global goal but still room for improvement.",
    "Big Climate Goal":
      "The Philippines has committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 75% by 2030 through its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)",
  },
  "📋 Why This Matters": {
    "1.5°C Goal":
      "Staying under 1.5°C warming means lowering emissions everywhere, even in countries like the Philippines with lower per capita emissions.",
